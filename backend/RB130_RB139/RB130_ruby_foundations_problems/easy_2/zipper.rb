# The Array#zip method takes two arrays, and combines them into a single array in which each element is a two-element array where the first element is a value from one array, and the second element is a value from the second array, in order. 

# Write your own version of zip that does the same type of operation. It should take two Arrays as arguments, and return a new Array (the original Arrays should not be changed). Do not use the built-in Array#zip method. You may assume that both input arrays have the same number of elements.

  loop do
    zipped_arr << [arr1[counter], arr2[counter]]
    counter += 1

end


puts zip([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) == [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
