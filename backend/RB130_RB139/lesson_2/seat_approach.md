# SEAT approach

In larger programs there are uasully four steps to writing a test:

1. Set up the necessary objects
2. Execute the code against the object we are testing
3. Assert the results of the execution
4. Tear down and clean up any lingering artifacts

In the examples we have covered so far we have only been doing steps 2 and 3.

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test

  def test_car_exists
    car = Car.new
    assert(car)
  end

  def test_wheels
    car = Car.new
    assert_equal(4, car.wheels)
  end

  def test_name_is_nil
    car = Car.new
    assert_nil(car.name)
  end

  def test_raise_initialize_with_arg
    assert_raises(ArgumentError) do
      car = Car.new(name: "Joey")
    end
  end

  def test_instance_of_car
    car = Car.new
    assert_instance_of(Car, car)
  end

  def test_includes_car
    car = Car.new
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr << car

    assert_includes(arr, car)
  end
end
```

For each test we've created a new instance of the `Car` class. This is redundant and can be extracted to a method that gets executed before the tests are run. In Minitest this is achieved with a `setup` instance method.

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
  def setup
    @car = Car.new
  end

  def test_car_exists
    assert(@car)
  end

  def test_wheels
    assert_equal(4, @car.wheels)
  end

  def test_name_is_nil
    assert_nil(@car.name)
  end

  def test_raise_initialize_with_arg
    assert_raises(ArgumentError) do
      Car.new(name: "Joey")
    end
  end

  def test_instance_of_car
    assert_instance_of(Car, @car)
  end

  def test_includes_car
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr << @car

    assert_includes(arr, @car)
  end
end
```

The `setup` method will be called before running every test and if we had a `teardown` method, that would be called after each test was run.
