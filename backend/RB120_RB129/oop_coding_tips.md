1. **Explore the problem before design**
It's difficult to determine all the required classes and methods when you first approach a problem. Take the time to explore the problem and with a **spike**, which is exploratory code. This can help validate hunches and hypotheses. A spike is through away code, like an intial brain dump.

2. **Repetitive nouns in method names is a sign you're missing a class.**

3. **Don't include the class name when naming methods**
Otherwise your code will look like this: `player1.player_info`.

4. **Avoid long method invocation chains.**
They are too vunerable to begin broken if you get an unexpected return value or `nil`.
